#X-Mas CTF 2019

##Quantum

The quantum challenges were a lot of fun for me since i knew almost nothing about quantum computing and the challenges helped me
a lot with getting started and then keeping up my interest when it got to the more complicated parts.

###Q-Trivia
This task was a quiz about all things quantum computing related. It helped a lot with getting to know the basics of quantum computing. It was basically a lot of reading through wikipedia pages.

Task:

```
Before we dive deeper into the Quantum Computing category, here are some basic trivia questions for warmup

Remote server: nc challs.xmas.htsp.ro 13003
*Author: Reda*

Hint! For superposition #1, you will find a very simple notation (made out of 3 characters) to show the 2 states after being superposed with an H gate.
```

When connecting to the server with netcat, we get the following introduction:

```
Welcome to Quantum Trivia! You will be presented with 4 categories with 5 questions each.
If you answer them correctly, I will reward you with a flag! Hooray!
NOTE: ONLY USE ASCII when answering questions. That means no foreign characters.
Good luck!
```

It then proceeds  with the first question category

####General Knowledge

```
Question: How are the special bits called in quantum computing
Your answer: qubits
```
This one i already knew the answer to, so there is not much to be said here.
Pretty much all of the other questions in this category could be solved by reading the wikipedia page about [qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit)
```
Question: What is the name of the graphical representation of the qubit?
Your answer: bloch sphere

Question: In what state is a qubit which is neither 1 or 0
Your answer: superposition

Question: What do you call 2 qubits which have interacted and are now in a wierd state in which they are correlated?
Your answer: entangled

Question: What do you call the notation used in Quantum Computing where qubits are represented like this: |0> or |1>?
Your answer: dirac
```

####Quantum Gates

Most of the answers in this category could be found on the the wikipedia page about [quantum logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)

```
Question: What gate would you use to put a qubit in a superposition
Your answer: CNOT

Question: What gate would you use to "flip" a qubit's phase in a superposition?
Your answer: Z

Question: What's the full name of the physicist who invented the X, Y and Z gates?
Your answer: wolfgang pauli
```
This actually required a seperate lookup since the gate-page only gave you the last name. If you were more well versed in physics than i was, you could've probably know the first name without having to look it up.

```
Question: What are quantum gates represented by (in dirac notation)
Your answer: matrix
```

####Superposition

```
Question: How do you represent a qubit |1> put in a superposition?
Your answer: |->
```
This was a tough question because the answer was really well hidden. I only found it after taking a closer look at the hint and actually looking up the wikipedia page for the [hadamard-transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_transform#Quantum_computing_applications) since the chapter on the quantum gates page didn't go enough into detail to mention it.

The next two questions are just yes-no answers so you could theoretically just try out which answer is correct but i knew the first and the second could be looked up on the wikipedia page for [quantum logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)

```
Question: Will a superposition break if measured
Your answer: yes

Question: Can you take a qubit out of a superposition with a Hadamard gate
Your answer: yes

Question: If you measure a qubit in a superposition, what's the average chance of measuring |0>?
Your answer: 50

Question: What's the name of the famous paradox which demonstrates the problem of decoherence?
Your answer: schrodinger's cat
```
This last answer was a little bit problematic for me since i am German and i looked up the correct english name which is
"Schrödinger's cat" and i didn't remember that the ö is sometimes replaced with o because it's not usually used in english so i looked around for other paradoxes such as the EPR-paradox until i tried the correct answer on a whim.

#### Entanglement

```
Question: Will particles always maeasure the same when entangled
Your answer: No

Question: Will entangled qubits violate Bell's Inequality?
Your answer: Yes
```
The answer to this question was mostly a guess on my part because i had read about bell states before so i assumed that qubits that were not in those states would violate the inequality.

```
Question: Does the following state present 2 entangled qubits? 1/sqrt(2)*(|10> + |11>)
Your answer: No

Question: Does the following state present 2 entangled qubits? 1/sqrt(2)*(|10> + |01>)
Your answer: Yes
```
Honestly i thought they were both entangled when answering the question during the CTF but looking back at it now, i can see
that the first qubit in the first question will always read to 1 and thus is not entangled.

```
Question: Can 2 entangled qubits ever get untangled?
Your answer: yes
```

With this last question completed, you will receive a message with the flag:

```
Congratz! You made it! ;)
Here's your flag: X-MAS{Qu4ntwm_Tantrum_M1llionar3}
```
